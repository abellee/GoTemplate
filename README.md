Golang plugin for sublimetext3



Description:
==========
This is a Golang plugin for SublimeText3(Only).

I think i won't support SublimeText2, so sorry guys.

Before you use this plugin, you'd better "Add Folder to Project".

First step: press "ctrl+n" in Mac OS X("alt+n" in Windows, "ctrl+n" in Linux),

then a quick panel will list all folders in sidebar.

Second step: if you were launching for the first time,

this step will let you type in the "source" directory of the project,

and save it into the project data file with the extension named "sublime-project",

so, if you changed the source dir, you should change the value of the **"source"** in the **XXXX.sublime-project**



Installation
============
press "shift+command+p" in Mac OS X("shift+ctrl+p" in Windows), and type in "Add Repository",

then paste "https://github.com/abellee/GoTemplate" in the panel that at the bottom of the window.



Shortcut
